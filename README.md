**Credit:** I found the Waltz piano version [in this youtube video by Alfred SC](https://youtu.be/KpF1RzgSl0c?si=NsviIw_DA_R5hc5C).

Unfortunately, the piano sheet on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/profile/creators?u=74962359)
was low quality, probably exported directly from a semi-quantized MIDI
recording, which caused weird notation and awkwardly placed clef changes.
Still, you want to send anyone cash making this version, it should be Alfred, not me!

This version is handwritten and laid out using [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/),
I'll argue that it's far more readable (once finished). **[Here is the PDF!](./kept.pdf)**

## 🏗️ Build

- Install [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/)
- `lilypond kept.ly`

## ⭐ Extras

### 🎵 Play MIDI generated by LilyPond

#### Using Qsynth

- Install Qsyth and any sound found you like
- Install your distro's package providing the `pmidi` command
- Launch Qsynch and configure the sound font
- Run `pmidi kept.midi`

With this approach, you can simultaneously connect a MIDI keyboard and have
QSynth play both the notes from your keyboard and the LilyPond-generated midi
file.

#### Using Timidity

- Install and configure [`timidity++`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Timidity%2B%2B)
- Compile the notes
- Run `timidity kept.midi`


### 🤖 Auto-build and auto play

- Install [`entr`](https://eradman.com/entrproject/)
- Run the `./autobuild` script from the repository
- Try the [`zathura` pdf viewer](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/zathura), it reloads the PDF file automatically on changes
